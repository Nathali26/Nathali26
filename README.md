👋🏻 Hi there, it's Nathalia here—so nice to have you visit!

👩🏻‍💼 I'm a passionate Junior Full Stack Developer with a strong foundation from CodeOp, where I recently graduated. My journey into the world of software development began with a deep interest in crafting applications that are not only functional but also visually appealing and user-friendly.

💼 With experience in both front-end and back-end development, I've had the opportunity to work on a variety of exciting projects ranging from web applications to database management systems. On the front-end, I specialize in technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js, creating engaging and responsive user interfaces that deliver an exceptional user experience. For back-end development, I have experience with Node.js, Python, MySQL, and building APIs that facilitate effective communication between the front-end and the database.

👩🏻‍💻 My professional journey includes roles such as a Frontend Developer Intern at Gold-Tree, where I supported senior developers in creating and updating web pages. Additionally, as an Admin/Digital Marketing Apprentice at CarryBags, I led SEO strategies and digital marketing campaigns with a focus on effective planning and budgeting. Before diving into technology, I worked in administrative and logistics coordination roles in Spain and the UK, honing skills such as time management, prioritization, and effective communication.

🎓 In addition to my Full Stack development training at CodeOp, I've furthered my knowledge with additional courses in software development, including coding programs at SheCodes and the renowned CS50 course from Harvard University. My academic background also includes a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Córdoba University in Spain.

🚀 On my GitHub profile, you'll find a variety of projects reflecting my skills and experiences, from interactive web applications to database management tools. Each project is an opportunity to learn, grow, and collaborate with the developer community. I'm always open to new collaboration opportunities and learning experiences, so feel free to reach out if you have exciting ideas or just want to chat about technology, software development, or any related topics.

⚡ Thank you for visiting my profile! I hope you find something that inspires you or helps you on your journey in the world of software development.
